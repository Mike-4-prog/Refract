# 📘 Refract Documentation (Capstone Project by Michael Uzukwu)

Welcome! This repository contains **my customized documentation site** for [Refract](https://github.com/TWMP-Refract/refract), a fictional JavaScript UI framework created by the Technical Writers Mentorship Program (TWMP).

## ✨ What is Refract?

Refract is a **React-inspired JavaScript framework** designed to provide technical writers with a realistic playground to develop:

- API references
- Conceptual explanations
- Tutorials
- Advanced guides
- Contribution workflows

This fictional project mimics a real-world developer ecosystem using ideas like **refractions**, **lenses**, **optics**, and **effects** to simulate complexity.
