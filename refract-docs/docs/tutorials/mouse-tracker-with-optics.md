This tutorial will walk you through building a small app that **tracks the user’s mouse position** in real time using **Optics** in Refract.

By the end, you’ll have:

- A component that reacts to mouse movement.
- State management powered by Optics.
- A live, reactive UI that updates without manual DOM handling.

### Setting Up

First, ensure you have a Refract project ready.

```bash
npm install refract
```
